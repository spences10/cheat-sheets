## Add an alias

```bash
# open your bash_profile with nano
nano ~/.bash_profile
# add your alias
alias f='fish'
# ctrl+x then y to save
```

## Sort alphabetically

You may find that commands like `ll` are under your `~/.bashrc` file,
if not then add the following as an alias:

```bash
ls -lart | sort -k9,9
```

## See file permissions

If you need to set the permission on a file (with `chmod`) but don't
know what the permissions of similar files are like you can use
`stat`, the following command displays the permissions of the contents
of the `.ssh/` folder:

```bash
stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh/*
```

## Open the SSH agent each time you open a new terminal.

Tired of having to enter your SSH password each time you want to do a
git operation?

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file.

```bash
# nano ~/.bashrc
[ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && eval "\$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

## Search Bash history

Want to search for an entry in your Bash history?

Use `Ctrl+r` then enter your search term.

## Remove command from bash history

Accidentally added your password as a bash command?

To remove that from the bash history:

```bash
# list out history with
history
```

Then take the number from the output:

```bash
471  ssh-agent
472  exit
473  kill 53111
474  super secret password
475  history
```

Then delete the line you want removed:

```bash
history -d 474
```

Check your `history` again and gone until you do it again.
