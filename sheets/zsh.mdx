## Use nvm with zsh

If you are using Oh My ZSH! then you can install the `zsh-nvm` plugin.

Clone the plugin into your zsh plugins folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-nvm
```

Then load as a plugin in your `.zshrc`

```bash
plugins+=(zsh-nvm)
```

Take a look a the [Permission denied when trying to install the
plugin] issue on GitHub for permission errors.
