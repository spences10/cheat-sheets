## Yarn global binaries not showing

When you globally add a package with yarn and it doesn't show in the
terminal.

Usually adding the path to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` works, try
adding this:

```bash
# nano ~/.bashrc
# or
# nano ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$PATH:$(yarn global bin)"
```

If that doesn't work you may need to set the yarn prefix.

**Steps**

Confirm your global bin path:

```bash
yarn global bin
```

I got: `/home/username/.yarn/bin`

**set yarn prefix:**

make sure your yarn prefix is the parent directory of your bin
directory. You can confirm by running

```bash
yarn config get prefix
```

When I ran this it was undefined, so I set it:

```bash
yarn config set prefix ~/.yarn
```

Add the following to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`"
```

## create-react-app

Couple of good one here from
[@beedesignllc](https://twitter.com/beedesignllc)

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app-name
```

☝️ downloads and runs latest `create-react-app` works for other
similarly named pkgs

## flow

```bash
yarn flow
```

☝️ will run `node_modules/.bin/flow` without you having to add it as a
package.json script.

## npm ci

The equivalent to `npm ci` for yarn:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```
