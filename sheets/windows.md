## Remote assistance

Windows 10 has a built-in tool you can use to remotely control other computers called [Quick Assist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/solve-pc-problems-over-a-remote-connection-b077e31a-16f4-2529-1a47-21f6a9040bf3).

No more need to tell family/friends to install tools like TeamViewer if you both have Windows installed.
The shortcut `ctrl + win + Q` opens it up.
