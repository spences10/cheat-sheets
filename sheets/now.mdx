The awesome now from zeit! It has a great cli with probably all of
this detailed in there under `-h` somewhere üòÅ

## Aliases

Got your own domain name? You can alias your latest `now` deployment

```bash
now alias now-generated-url.now.sh your-awesome-domain-name.af
```

## Scale your deployment

Want your site to not get frozen? And have visitors have to wait for
the instance to spin up?

This is straight from the CLI with `now scale -h`

```bash
# Create an deployment with 3 instances, never sleeps:
now scale my-deployment-ntahoeato.now.sh 3
# Create an automatically scaling deployment:
now scale my-deployment-ntahoeato.now.sh 1 5
# Create an automatically scaling deployment without specifying max:
now scale my-deployment-ntahoeato.now.sh 1 auto
# Create an automatically scaling deployment without specifying min or max:
now scale my-deployment-ntahoeato.now.sh auto
# Create an deployment that is always active and never "sleeps":
now scale my-deployment-ntahoeato.now.sh 1
```

## Environment variables

Config stuff I always forget!

If it's keys, then use secrets and configure them in the
`package.json`:

```json
 "now": {
    "alias": "cool",
    "env": {
      "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "@aws_access_key_id",
      "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "@aws_secret_access_key",
      "MONGODB_URI": "@mongodb_uri",
      "S3_BUCKET_NAME": "@s3_bucket_name",
      "SECRET": "@secret"
    }
  },
```

If you have a lot of configuration variables and you dont want to make
a mess in the `package.json`:

```bash
now -E
```

That will pull your `.env` file and use that in place of adding
individual vars via `now -e var`. I have always used `dotenv` and I
understand that `now` uses `dotenv` for this and using without is
untested by me?
