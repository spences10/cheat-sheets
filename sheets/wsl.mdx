## Linuxbrew

Linuxbrew is like Chocolatey for Windows or Homebrew for OSx

```bash
brew install package
```

## What version of Ubuntu is installed

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

## lxrun.exe

Use `lxrun.exe` to interact with the WSL from the CMD prompt

Burn it all ðŸ”¥:

```bash
lxrun /uninstall /full
```
