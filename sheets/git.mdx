This is just stuff that I have put down that I find I use a lot of the
time for my own reference.

## Add a new repo from your machine to GitHub

```bash
echo "# name-of-your-awesome-repo" >> README.md # add repo name to README.md
git init # init the repository
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/spences10/name-of-your-awesome-repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

The first four commands can be ignored if you have done more work on
the repo than adding a README.md

## Latest changes from repo to your machine

```bash
git pull
```

## Add tracking information to your work

Assuming that you are working on the master branch then

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
```

You can set it to whatever branch you want to track changes for

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>
```

This will mean you can just do `git pull` and the latest changes will
be pulled to your `origin`

## What branch

```bash
git branch # shows what branch you're on
git branch -r # shows remote branches
git branch -a # shows all branches
```

## Create a local branch and push it to GitHub

Want to make your feature branch and get it on GitHub?

Make your branch first then:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-you-just-created>
```

## Create a PR [Pull Request]

Fork other users repo in GitHub, then clone to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/awesome-awesome-repo
```

Add the remote repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OtherUserName/awesome-awesome-repo
```

Create your branch:

```bash
git branch your-awesome-branch
```

Check it out:

```bash
git checkout your-awesome-branch
```

If adding a folder use.

```bash
git add nameOfFolder/\\*
```

Make your commit and push to your new branch.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin your-awesome-branch
```

Manage the rest of the PR via GitHub

## Check remotes

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Sync a remote fork on your machine

First configure the local to point to the remote upstream

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
git remote -v
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

You then use `git merge` to update any branch on the upstream
repository:

```bash
git merge upstream/dev
```

Take a look at [syncing a fork] for more details.

## Sync a remote fork on Github

1.  Open your fork on GitHub.
1.  Click on Pull Requests.
1.  Click on New Pull Request. By default, GitHub will compare the
    original with your fork, and there shouldn't be anything to
    compare if you didn't make any changes.
1.  Click on Try `switching the base`. Now GitHub will compare your
    fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
1.  Click on Click to create a pull request for this comparison and
    assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from
    original).
1.  Click on Send pull request.
1.  Scroll down and click Merge pull request and finally Confirm
    merge. If your fork didn't have any changes, you will be able to
    merge it automatically.

## 2fa

Using two factor authentication? Then use the following so you're not
adding in your auth token each time you want to `push` your code.

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://yourgithubuser:your-token@github.com/yourgithubuser/yourrepo.git
```

## Change `origin` url

If you want to change the origin url you can use the `set-url` command

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/new-repo-name
```

## Add code on your machine to new repo

Via terminal navigate to your code folder.

```bash
git init
```

Add your files.

```bash
git add .
```

Adding a folder use the following syntax or it'll get added as a BLOB.

```bash
git add nameOfFolder/\\*
```

Commit to local repo.

```bash
git commit -m 'some detailed message'
```

To add your files to the remote repo,
[first add your remote repo](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/)

```bash
git remote add origin [remote repository URL] # Sets the new remote
git remote -v # Verifies the new remote URL
git push origin master
```

For more info check out: [adding an existing project to github using
the command line]

## Delete branches

Delete local branch.

```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

Remove local branches that are not on the `remote`.

```bash
git remote prune origin
```

Remove local branches that were created from remote branches.

```bash
git branch --merged master | grep -v '^[ *]*master$' | xargs git branch -d
```

## Merge master branch into feature branch

How to merge the master branch into the feature branch? This will come
up often if you are workingon a team with other devs and you want to
update your feature branch to include the latest changes.

```bash
# checkout your feature branch
git checkout feature1
# merge master into it
git merge master
```

## Merge two repos

If you want to merge project-a into project-b:

```bash
cd path/to/project-b
git remote add project-a path/to/project-a
git fetch project-a
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories project-a/master # or whichever branch you want to merge
git remote remove project-a
```

## Stop tracking a file

If you have `.env` files that are tracked by Git and want to ignore
them so your API keys don't get added to GitHub use:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
```

## Stop tracking a previously tracked folder

First add the folder to your `.gitignore` then remove the folder from
your local git tracking with:

```bash
git rm -r --cached <folder>
```

## Start tracking a previously un-tracked file

```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>
```

## Cloning a repo from someone else's GitHub and pushing it to a repo on my GitHub

So you make a clone, make some changes then realise that you need to
add it to your GitHub account before making a pull

```bash
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/OtherUser/OtherUserRepo (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/OtherUser/OtherUserRepo (push)
```

You just need to set the `origin` to yours then add the `upstream` as
the original `origin` make sense?

So change `origin` to yours:

```bash
git remote set-url origin http://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo
```

Then add `upsrtream` as theirs:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OtherUser/OtherUserRepo
```

Now it should look something like this:

```bash
git remote -v
origin  http://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo (fetch)
origin  http://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo (push)
upstream        https://github.com/OtherUser/OtherUserRepo (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/OtherUser/OtherUserRepo (push)
```

## Remove an `upstream` repository

If you no longer need a reference to a forked repository then remove
it with the following:

```bash
git remote rm upstream
```

## Clone a repo and give it a different name

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repoNameYouToChange NameYouWantToGiveToRepo
```

## Using Husky?

If you are pushing right after a commit, you can use
`git push --no-verify` to avoid running all the tests again.

If you make a trivial change and want to commit
`git commit -m 'some detailed message' --no-verify` will skip your
`precommit` and `prepush` scripts.

## How to read last commit comment?

```bash
git show # is the fastest to type, but shows you the diff as well.
git log -1 # is fast and simple.
git log -1 --pretty=%B # if you need just the commit message and nothing else.
```

## Remove commit from pull request

Read
[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34519665/how-to-move-head-back-to-a-previous-location-detached-head/34519716#34519716)
for more detail on how to revert.

This was the simplest approach I found:

```bash
# Checkout the desired branch
git checkout <branch>
# Undo the desired commit
git revert <commit>
# Update the remote with the undo of the code
git push origin <branch>
```

Rather than use the last part I unstaged the changes in VSCode which I
think did the same thing.

## Show `.gitconfig` details

There are there are three leves for Git config:

**System level**

```bash
# to view
git config --list --system
# to set
git config --system color.ui true
```

**Global level**

```bash
# to view
git config --list --global
# to set
git config --global user.name xyz
```

**Repository level**

```bash
# to view
git config --list --local
# to set
git config --local core.ignorecase true # (--local optional)
# to edit repository config file
git config --edit --local # (--local optional)
```

**View All Settings**

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```

[info](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46986031/1138354)

## Conflicts between Windows Git and WSL Git?

If you are having issues with changes showing in Windows Git and not
Windows Subsystem Linux Git (For a Windows WSL Dev set-up) then check
the settings of each environment by using:

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```

Remove any conflicting settings then try again.

## If you want to rename a branch while pointed to any branch, do:

```bash
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
```

If you want to rename the current branch, you can do:

```bash
git branch -m <newname>
```

A way to remember this, is `-m` is for "move" (or `mv`), which is how
you rename files.

## Git ref log

Want to know what work you have done on a repo? Use `git reflog` to
displpay all the commits.

```bash
# show all changes for the last 90 days
git reflog show -a
# show changes with a date
git reflog --date=iso
```

## Use SSH in place of HTTPS

Get your SSH set up on your machine and add a key to GitHub, more on
that here:
https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-authenticate-with-github-using-ssh

You will then need to pick your **Clone with SSH** option from the
**Clone or download** section on your repo page.

Once you have taken the link from there you will need to set the repo
remote to the SSH URL

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo-name-here.git
```

Where username is the `username` of the repo owner and
`repo-name-here` is the name of that user's repository.

## How to authenticate with GitHub using SSH

Check that there are no `rsa` files here before continuing, use (bash
or Git bash if you're on Windows):

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If there's nothing there then generate a new keygen with:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your@email.com # add your email address 👍
```

> If you decide to use a password for your SSH key see
> [SSH Keys With Passwords](#ssh-keys-with-passwords)

Now using `ls -al ~/.ssh` will show our `id_rsa.pub` file.

Add the SSH key to the SSH agent:

```bash
# for mac and Linux from bash, also from Windows Git Bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# for Git Bash on Windows
eval `ssh-agent -s`
# fir Fish shell
eval (ssh-agent -c)
```

Add RSA key to SSH with:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Copy your key to clipboard with one of the following:

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Windows
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Linux
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_github.pub # Mac
```

Add a new SSH Key to your GitHub profile from the [settings] page by
clicking the [New SSH key] button and paste in your key. Save it...

[settings]: https://github.com/settings/keys
[new ssh key]: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

Then authenticate with:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you go back to the GitHub setting page and refresh the key icon
should go from black to green. 🎉

### SSH Keys With Passwords

If you add a password to your SSH key you will find yourself entering
the password to authenticate on each [pull, push] operation. This can
get tedious, especially if you have a long password in your keys.

Add the following line to your `~/.ssh/config/` file:

```bash
AddKeysToAgent yes
```

Open or create the `~/.ssh/config` file with:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

The SSH agent will also need to be started on each terminal session
now to store the keys in, add the follwowinf to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
[ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Open the `~/.bashrc` file with:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Now the SSH agent will start on each terminal session and you will
only be prompted for the password on the first `pull`, `push`
operation.

## Use multiple SSH keys

If you have more than one GitHub account or if you have AWS code
commit account then you will need to set up a `config` file, add your
SSH key the same as detailed in
[How to authenticate with GitHub using SSH](#how-to-authenticate-with-github-using-ssh)
and give the key a different name:

```bash
# ls ~/.ssh
~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_1
~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_2
~/.ssh/id_rsa_git_aws
```

You can delete all cached keys before, with:

```bash
ssh-add -D
```

You can check your saved keys, with:

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

Set up the SSH config file, check to see if you haven't got a `config`
file already set up with:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh/
```

If you haven't got a `config` file there then:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh/
touch config
```

Use your text editor of choice, in this example we'll use `nano`:

```bash
nano config
```

Add your configuration:

```bash
AddKeysToAgent yes

# github_1 account
Host github.com-github_1
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_1

# github_2 account
Host github.com-github_2
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_2

# AWS code commit account
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
	User AWSUSERNAME
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_git_aws
```

Clone your repo and modify the config file of the repo as detailed
here:
[Specify multiple users for myself in .gitconfig?](#specify-multiple-users-for-myself-in-gitconfig)

There's a great Gist detailing this
[here](https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996) for more detail if
needed.

## Re-use SSH keys, from one machine to another

If you want to avoid creating multiple SSH keys for different
environments and move your `.ssh` folder from one machine to another
then you can do the following:

Copy your `.ssh` and `.gitconfig` files:

Copy from Linux to Windows

```bash
cp ~/.ssh/* /c/Users/Scott.Spence/.linuxFiles/.ssh/
cp ~/.gitconfig /c/Users/Scott.Spence/.linuxFiles/
```

Copy from Windows to Linux

```bash
cp /mnt/c/Users/Scott.Spence/.linuxFiles/.ssh/* ~/.ssh/
# Reset the permissions back to default:
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
cp /mnt/c/Users/Scott.Spence/.linuxFiles/.* ~/
chmod 644 ~/.gitconfig
```

Start the SSH agent with:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" # for mac and Linux from bash, also from Windows Git Bash
```

Add your SSH key to the `ssh-agent` with:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then authenticate with:

```bash
# GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com
# Bitbucket
ssh -T git@bitbucket.org
```

## Using SSH over the HTTPS port

SSH can be tunnelled over HTTPS if the network you are on blocks the
SSH port.

Test if SSH over HTTPS is possible with:

```bash
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
```

If you get a response then, edit your `~/.ssh/config` file and add
this section:

```bash
Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
```

Check that you have a key already added with:

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

If nothing is listed then add in your key with:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Test that is has worked with:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Change SSH key password

Tired of typing your SSH key password because you made it a 32
characters and can't stand the manotoney anymore?

Still want to have a SSH key password on your existing SSH key?

Use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Specify multiple users for myself in .gitconfig?

Want to have different git credentials for one specific repository?

You can configure an individual git repo to use a specific user/email
address which overrides the global configuration.

To list out the config for the repo:

```bash
git config --list --local
```

From the root of the repo, run:

```bash
git config user.name 'Your Name'
git config user.email 'your@email.com'
```

Whereas the default user / email is configured in your `~/.gitconfig`

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'
```

## Cant remember what your last git commit said?

```bash
git show
```

## Rebase changes

If you're working on a team and there have been changes to the main
branch you want to push your changes to, you can rebase before
submitting a PR.

In this scenario we're going to rebase our `feature` branch off of the
`develop` branch

```bash
# switch from your feature to get latest develop changes
git checkout develop
git pull
# checkout the feature branch and rebase
git checkout feature
git rebase develop
```

Then use the prompts from there in conjunction with your text editor
to add in the changes.

```bash
# add a change
git add
# continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
# have an unrelated change, nothing to correct
git rebase --skip
# oh DERP! Want to start over?
git rebase --abort
```

## Rebase accept incoming in bulk

If you have a large file (like a `package-lock.json`) that you want to
accept all the incoming changes from then.

Whilst you're in rebase you'll need to check out the file from your
incoming branch then add it as the new file.

```bash
# checkout the file
git checkout temp-branch -- package-lock.json
# add the file whilst in rebase
git add package-lock.json
# continue with the things
git rebase --continue
```

## See differences between two branches

If you want to see the difference between two branches then use the
git built in diff tool.

```bash
git diff branch1..branch2
```

## See differences between two files

If you want to see the difference between two file across different
branches then use.

```bash
git diff branch1..branch2 package.json
```

## Revert to a previous commit

Find the commit you want to revert to, then:

```bash
git reset hashOfCommit
```

Then reset to the branch on the origin:

```bash
# if I wanted to push back to the develop branch on GitHub say
git reset --soft origin/develop
```

## Gitignore

You can automate the creation of your projects `gitignore` file using
the [gitignore API](https://docs.gitignore.io/install/command-line).

Setup the API:

```
git config --global alias.ignore \
'!gi() { curl -sL https://www.gitignore.io/api/$@ ;}; gi'
```

Add to your shell configuration:

Bash

```
echo "function gi() { curl -sL https://www.gitignore.io/api/\$@ ;}" >> \
~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

checkout `gi list` for the languages and editors supported. You can
issue the following command inside your project

```
gi linux,visualstudiocode,node >> ./.gitignore
```

If you find yourself using the same `.gitignore` on your projects you
can create a global file (i.e. `.gitignore_global`), and copy to your
new project.

Reference: https://docs.gitignore.io/install/command-line
