## Install a binary

If you're working on a local machine with administrator permissions,
you may want to add downloaded-binary to your PATH, so that you can
access it directly from any project folder. You could do this by
extracting it to a directory that is already on your PATH. (For
example, `/usr/local/bin` is a common choice for Mac and Linux.).

```bash
# navigate to download location of .tar.gz
sudo mv downloaded-binary.tar.gz /usr/local/bin/downloaded-binary.tar.gz
sudo tar zxf downloaded-binary.tar.gz
```
