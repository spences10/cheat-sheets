# imposter syndrome disclaimer

A warm invitation to contribute, to be adapted and included in your
project's README

### How to contribute

_Imposter syndrome disclaimer_: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready;
that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or
write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations
that you can read here (link).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to
follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process
explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing
documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And
yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!

### About this work

I came up with the idea of an imposter syndrome disclaimer for project
READMEs while working on my 2016 talks for
[OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx-2016/public/schedule/speaker/230023)
and [PyCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo). A goal was
to share how leaders, mentors, and maintainers could become more
accessible, welcoming collaborators with junior developers. Being
explicitly welcoming and providing clear contribution guidelines is a
powerful way to encourage others to contribute to your work.

### Examples

I'm thrilled that projects have adopted this language! Here are a few
[examples](https://github.com/adriennefriend/imposter-syndrome-disclaimer/blob/master/examples.md).

### Licensing
